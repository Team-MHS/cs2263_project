# cs2263_project
Class project for CS2263 

The project was to develop a digital version of the game Acquire. We did not get to complete our project because everyone on the team had too much else going on to really focus on this particular assignment. What we have so far allows for at least two people to play the game. We just were not able to implement most of the features that we would have wanted to due to the lack of time.
